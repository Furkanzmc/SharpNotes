# SharpNotes

This was a project I made to improve my programming skills when I was in my second year of high school. I was hosting this on Codeplex at the time and haven't touched it since. Now that Codeplex is shutting down, I'm moving it here for nostalgic purposes and I'm leaving everyting as it was 7 years ago.
